# Eloquence
Eloquence is a novel writing application, created as a personal project during my studies at Dev Academy. It is a passion project and a work in progress. As a writer, I have been inspired by other writing software that I have used. I thought I would attempt to create my own using the tech stack that I was being taught.

## Tech
Eloquence is currently using TypeScript, React, TailwindCss, SQLITE3 (with knex) and Vite. QuillJs is used as the text editor

## Writing software
This is my initial plan and design
